Brief Overview:
This game allows users to select a starting board game configuration on the microcontroller with a LED screen. Then, users can turn the rotary knobs (one for left right movement and another for up down movement) to determine where they will place a pixel on the LED screen. Pressing the rotary knobs allows the user to switch between colors. Once a color has been placed, the user fills the board accordingly. Once the entire LED screen is filled with pixels, the program checks to see if it is a winning or losing configuration. It then makes a sound accordingly.
